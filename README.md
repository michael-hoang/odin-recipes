The goal of this project is to create a basic looking recipe website using the HTML knowledge 
that I have acquired from The Odin Project. This website will have a main index page 
containing hyperlinks to a few amazing recipes. I will be applying elements such as anchors, 
images, ordered and unordered lists, and paragraphs.
